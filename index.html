    <p> Hello everyone my name is Kevin Menez I'm from Los Angeles California.
      I'm a transfer student and I'm in my 2 year at UCSC. My major is FDM
      (Film and digital media). I have never been to the school campus or
      attendee In person classes, due to the pandemic. I transferred when the
      pandemic started in 2020, didn't get to have the full experience of
      transferring to a UC, however I'm thankful that I'm here and hopefully in
      the Fall/ Spring semester I will visit the campus. I have zero experience
      in coding, I am kind of nervous in taking this class but excited at the
      same time. </p>
