            <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>Working by my slef I think me classmates dont like me but is ok for me lol, I create a
               function that depends on conditionals.</p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>For me, I'm crafting these exercises new this year, though I have taught
              JavaScript down but it is going well I like thw work and all. Trying to create
              exercises and code that build on  previous things we've learned <i>and</i> experiment
               with new things </p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>I created a pretty straight forward conditional in my function, but realized after writing it,
               the repetitive structure probably means there is a more efficient way to write this.
                Probably using an object as key-value pairs will be simple, work really well, and be easy
                 to maintain.</p>
