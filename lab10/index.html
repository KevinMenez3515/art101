            <h1>Lab 10: <span id="title">JavaScript Events and Forms</span></h1>

            <p>Working with your partner, not relly but I love working by my slfe IDK,
              is fun on zoom.</p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>The sorted name was easy because knew how to do it i seen it on youtube and on th hube.
              I'd never done that before (that I remember). I definitely fooled around a
               good bit to get the CSS to place the name over my image. There are still long names that break the formatting,
               but it's okay for now -- a balance of simple coding and interesting results.</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>I'm happy with the output and wanted to type in all of my friends names to see the ridiculous anagrams. Here is the program execution:</p>
            <div>
              <input type="text" id="user-name"><br>
              <button id="my-button">Submit</button>
              <div id="output"><p id="name-results">Ienkv</p></div>

            </div>
            <div class="linkbox">

            </div>
