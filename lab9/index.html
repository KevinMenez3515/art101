	 <h1> Lab 9 JavaScript for the Web </h1>
	 <p> The idea of this Lab was to further create a local file
		 structure on my computer and add index. html files. </p>
   <h2> Challenges </h2>
	 <p> It was not easy in creating the filme structure once I got the hang of
		 it, but I had some difficulty creating index.html files and making
		 them work right. </p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p> Well you are looking at the index.html file I created. Here is the file
		structure thats I made:Well hopefully you are able to see our index.html
	file that we have created, and everything is well. </p>
